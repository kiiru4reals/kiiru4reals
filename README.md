### <p align="center"> Hi there! I am Kiiru Maina </p>

I am a cyber security enthusiast from Nairobi, Kenya with a keen interest in mobile programming, web, network and cloud security. Is this the place I mention that I am a Linux addict? 

When I am free I'd be trying to program using flutter because it is some kick ass framework!

- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in IT GRC, Application Security and DevSecOps.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Red teaming essentials.
- ðŸ“« Send me a DM on twitter [@kiiru4reals](https://twitter.com/kiiru4reals) and I shall get back to you!
